#### this project was very usefull to my hard skills, in that i used JavaScript to make a calculator, using the event concept to get the action to functions with the determinated script.
### What does the calculator do?
##### Aside the fact of the operations (+ - * / ), the calculate previne some things like:
<ul>
  <li>make it impossible to put a sign after another one</li>
  <li>does not take into account the sign in the last position</li>
</ul>
<h3>Used content</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Arrow Functions</b> was used in place of the classic function</li>
  <li>i used <b>Arrays</b> to guard digited values</li>
</ul>
